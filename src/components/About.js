            <p>
                Hi, my name is Anthony, a DApp smart contract developer. Like most others in this space,
                I am fascinated by this technoloy and what it means for our future as a whole. 
                Between digital ownership, true digital uniquenesss/representation of real world items,
                DAOs, and all the other awesome technologies, the future of a new Decentralized Internet is bright. 
                
                And I look forward to doing my part to help build it!
            </p>
